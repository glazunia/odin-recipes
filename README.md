# odin-recipes

This is a project for The Odin Project Foundations course. It is a simple website with a few recipes. The project should demonstrate my current knowledge of basic HTML. [Link to the project lesson](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes)

Simple styles were added later during the course.
